    "This paper aims to use the machine learning to predict the run time of 3-colorability on a graph and its tree-decomposition. Thus we can generate multiple tree-decomposition, and find the fastest one then solve it.\n",

    "This project chooses the 3-colorability as an example because it is a relatively easy NP-complete problem. This paper may first introducing some background information and give a fully view of how the project built.\n",

    "This project conducts 3 parts, including data generating part, machine learning part and final test part. All 3 parts will be fully explained below analyses.\n",

    "In conclusion, the paper will show the findings of optimization through machine learning on the tree-decompositions and try to explain the reasons behind such result."

    "\n",
    "From the basic algorithm, the most traditional algorithm is to enumerate the colors of all nodes. After that, graph-coloring problem is determined to be the NP-complete problem. Rather than solve the problem straightforward, academic circle tries to reduce the scale of the problem. Tree-decomposition is an effective method to reduce the scale of origin problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the focus is shifted to the problems on the tree-decompositions. Improved tree-decomposition methods are found to form a more standard and solvable structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, machine learning was introduced into this problem. Machine learning is used to predict the run time of tree-decomposition structure and help problem-solver to dicide to solve which structure."

    "We generate the data by ourselves. We uniformly randomly generate the graph, and use the combined algorithm to generate multiple tree-decompositions. In total, we generate 2000 graphs and each graph 100 tree-decompositions for training, 200 graphs and each graph 100 tree-decomposition for testing. After that, we try several models and analysis them, detailed information could be found in our articles \"Machine Learning\" part. At last, we compare the Machine Learning predictor and theoretic predictor and random predictor."
